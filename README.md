# Character Name Database Plugin for Beat

A bare-bones Beat plugin using Trelby's name database. This should be optimized and polished.

Copy the "Character Name Database.beatPlugin" folder to `~/Application Support/Beat/Plugins/`.

Beat's plugins folder can also be opened through the application itself. Under the "Tools" menu, navigate to "Plugins" and select "Open Plugin Folder...", which then opens the folder in Finder.

**NOTE**: Requires Beat 1.7.2 or later.
